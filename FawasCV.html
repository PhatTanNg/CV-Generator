<!-- I learned how to make a CV resume by looking at examples on W3Schools. Their examples were very helpful in showing me how to structure and format the document, as well as what content to include. For example, I learned about using headings, lists, and tables to organize the information, and how to use CSS to style the document. Thanks to W3Schools, I feel much more confident in my ability to create a professional-looking CV resume. https://www.w3schools.com/-->
